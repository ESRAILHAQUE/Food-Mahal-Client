            Chef Austin and his team “hands down” made our family Thanksgiving
            in Montana the highlight of the year! From my first experience with
            R&D they were very responsive to emails and attentive to my
            requests. Chef worked with me to adjust the menu and I was so
            impressed by how thoughtful his recommendations were-hearty and sure
            to satisfy for the big eaters in the group but at the same time
            elevated and sophisticated for the foodies. Also, my son has an egg
            allergy and he made sure exclude it from the menu. During the day of
            the dinner this team came prepared with all of the cook, dish and
            serving ware. To add they made great company through the afternoon
            and really engaged us in the meal they were preparing. Needless to
            say the food was AMAZING and we will be talking about this
            Thanksgiving for years to come. Thank you Chef Austin and crew- you
            knocked it out of the park!

          I called on Austin to do the impossible - replace an originally
          planned 20th anniversary celebration of 100 people or so, canceled due
          to COVID - with an intimate dinner for two that could still respect
          the monumental nature of the occasion. He and Nicole came to my condo
          loaded with all of their supplies, utensils, food, wine glasses, wine
          selection and in the space of a few hours created from scratch one of
          the most memorable nights of our lives. The stone crab claw appetizer,
          the she-crab bisque, the crushed beet salad, Lobster Thermidor, Meyer
          lemon posset and multiple complementary wine selections were culinary
          perfection in both taste and presentation. Both Austin and Nicole were
          a pleasure to have in our home as they prepared, served and cleaned up
          from the meal. Despite this being such a smaller event than I am sure
          they are accustomed to, they treated us with so much respect and the
          occasion with such enthusiasm that we always felt as important as any
          other clients they may have taken care of and as if they were having
          as much fun as we were. My husband, for whom this was a surprise, was
          as delighted as I was. If the scale is one to 5 stars, they deserve
          stars by the dozens.

            Austin and his team were definitely a major plus to our end of the
            wedding weekend. We had him come in to serve 20 of our family
            members as a “Thank you dinner” for coming to Big Sky for our sons
            wedding during this very difficult 2020 all the way from Texas. I
            liked Austin right away when I had called him. Delightful, friendly
            and totally understood what I wanted. He was eager to make
            everything perfect for our dinner. My husband has never cared for
            scallops but now he is all over them. They were delicious as well as
            the lobster among all the other surprises he prepared for us. I most
            definitely will call him again when we go back to Big Sky. Thank you
            Austin. You made an unforgettable memory for our Family.

            Chef Austin catered a dinner for our family last January. It was so
            memorable that here I am in October writing a review of his dinner.
            As someone who loves to cook, and entertains frequently, I kept
            trying to help Chef and Nikki with their work. They were so adept at
            managing my “help” that I finally relaxed and let them take total
            care of us. It was one of the most memorable meals I have shared
            with the people that I love. It is obvious that Chef Austin puts his
            heart in his work. The food was sublime, his suggested wine pairings
            were spot-on and Nikki was so engaged with us as we ate. As I said,
            It has been 10 months since that meal, and I remember it as if were
            last night. There was some adjustment for serious food allergies,
            but it was a seamless process, and Chef Austin’s choices were
            superb. We are planning another visit to Big Sky and already have
            Chef Austin on our list of things to do.
